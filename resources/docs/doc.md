#### Managing your middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `multigloss.middleware` namespace.

This namespace is reserved for any custom middleware for the application. Some default middleware is
already defined here. The middleware is assembled in the `wrap-base` function.

Middleware used for development is placed in the `multigloss.dev-middleware` namespace found in
the `env/dev/clj/` source path.
